      <description>At work we were recently looking into setting up somethings in DynamoDB with Spring Boot for the first time as a team. We hit up Google and ended up on this page, https://www.baeldung.com/spring-data-dynamodb. Within a couple of seconds of reading there were a couple issues with this article that made we want to write this post. Now I know there are going to be issues with this post as well but I&amp;rsquo;m covering the big ones that were in that post.</description>

      <description>In this post we&amp;rsquo;re going to build a simple serverless self-hosted analytics system. This is the simple set-up that I currently use to track visitors to my website. We&amp;rsquo;ll use a few simple tools to track visitors of our websites.
Overview The tools and services we&amp;rsquo;re going to use to build our simple analytics are:
 Golang Serverless framework AWS Lambda AWS Cloudwatch Javascript  Golang/AWS Lambda/Serverless Framework To get things off the ground we want to implement a lambda function that we can hit when someone vists our website.</description>
